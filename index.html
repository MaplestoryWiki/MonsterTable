Their appearance is also different, as Antoinette is purple, and Pianus is orange, much like the Silent Crusade Pianus. Also, instead of an X-shaped scar like Pianus, it has Arkarium's insignia, a menacing eye.</td></tr>

From time to time, he will spit out 3 fireballs in a row, all with the ability to instant kill, no matter how much HP you have. He can also leap from one side to the other, also an instant kill attack. When at about 40% HP, he will start launching poison from its head, which lands on the ground and does 10,000 damage a second. He can appear on one side and breathe fire that pulls you toward it, killing you if you get too close.When you kill him, you have to wait for him to finish his attacking animation before his death animation begins.
